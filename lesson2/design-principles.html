            <p>Pinterest is a good example of alignment, the mobile view of this site manages to make it looks neat and well ordered even though the width and height of every photo are different from one another, and that is because of the organized alignment they apply on the site which makes it better and cleans the site.</p>

            <h4>500px</h4>
            <p><a href="https://500px.com/">500px site here</a></p>
            <img src="images/500px-photo.jpg" alt="mobile-view-of-website-500px">
            <p>500px did a great job of visual hierarchy as you look at the website the first thing that the viewers call attention to is the word "what makes us different followed by the button to sign up which calls the attention of the visitor to sign up for their website.</p>

            <img src="images/flickr-photo.jpg" alt="website-view-of-flickr">
            <p>Flicker is a great example of Fitt's Law, as you can see on the website the user will primarily choose to start the free trial because it is predictive that the only option for the new user is to click the button "start for free" or to login.</p>
